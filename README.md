# Joplin Plugin
A plugin that allows with a shortcut to start a note in a default folder (regardless of what
folder you have currently selected) using a shortcut (defaults to ctrl-o) 

While I'm working, I often don't know what folder I really want 
the note to end up in, so I created a '\_misc' folder ('_inbox' or '_temp' are other good names), and when I 
activate the shortcut  a new note is started in this folder. 

# Note
I just vibe coded this with Claude but it works well enough for me.

I don't really know TypeScript (but code in Java/Go) so someone else free to make this better.

# Usage
In Tools -> Options -> Plugins

Set the id of the default folder you want notes to be created in when you activate the shortcut and you can modify the shortcut used as well.
