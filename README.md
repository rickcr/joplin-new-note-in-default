# Joplin Plugin

I just vibe coded this with Claude but it works well enough for me.

I don't really know TypeScript (but code in Java/Go) so someone else free to make this better.

# Usage
In Tools -> Options -> Plugins

set the id of the default folder you want notes to be created in when you activate the shortcut.


# TODO

- make short-cut configurable? (I plan to use ctrl-o so just hardcoded it)
- make the note title have an override in settings 
- have an option to default to title that the user starts with for editing (vs body)
